                                        70% of long-term portfolio returns are
                                        attributable to asset allocation—the mix of stocks, bonds, cash, or
                                        other securities you own at any given time. Our
                                        approach begins with a comprehensive understanding of your personal
                                        situation, goals, and needs. This information forms
                                        the foundation of our top-down investment process.
                                        We gather a wide range of data inputs, utilizing both qualitative and
                                        quantitative applications of our proprietary
                                        capital markets technology. Our analysis of current market conditions,
                                        historical trends, and behavioral factors informs
                                        our dynamic tactical asset allocation decisions. This process helps us
                                        determine the optimal mix of investments that we
                                        believe will maximize the likelihood of reaching your financial goals.

                                        However, being a truly hands-off investor demands exceptional
                                        self-control that many individuals often find challenging
                                        to maintain. Investors frequently respond emotionally to uncertainty,
                                        whether through market fluctuations or economic,
                                        political, or personal challenges.
                                        Research indicates that people experience the negative impacts of a loss
                                        twice as intensely as the positive effects of a
                                        gain. Consequently, even relatively modest volatility or downturns can
                                        trigger investor anxiety and overreactions to
                                        short-term changes, leading to premature market exits and missed
                                        recovery opportunities.

                                        What many investors require is an asset allocation aligned with their long-term goals. As we've discussed, having the
                                        discipline to weather the ups and downs of a hands-off approach is something many struggle with, so it's also valuable
                                        to consider how your investment adviser may help prevent you from making a costly error in judgment.
                                        The key with either dynamic or static investment is to maintain consistency and adhere to your strategy. The distinction
                                        is that with a dynamic manager, you have a knowledgeable partner to help you navigate a steady course when emotions and
                                        uncertainty arise.
