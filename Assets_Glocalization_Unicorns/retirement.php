                                    Retirement planning can be stressful. Investors often need guidance to
                                    develop a plan that can achieve their
                                    goals.
                                    There are plenty of financial service professionals—including brokers,
                                    financial planners, retirement
                                    advisers, and
                                    others—who claim to be able to help. But with so many voices, how do you
                                    know whom to trust? And how do you
                                    know you're
                                    paying for the right advice?

                                    Establishing your financial goals is the first step to successful retirement
                                    planning. Everyone has unique goals, but
                                    most fit into a few broad categories:

                                        <li class="mt-3">
                                            <b>Avoid running out of money:</b> This is a number-one priority—and
                                            number-one fear—for many. Being forced to go back to work
                                            or turn to children for income during retirement can be a source of
                                            anxiety for current and future retirees.
                                        </li>

                                            many is to maintain—or better yet, improve—their circumstances
                                            during retirement.

                                            individuals, a goal may even be to grow their wealth over the long
                                            term—potentially to give to children, grandchildren
                                            or a charity.

                                            <b>Spend everything: </b>This isn't a typical goal, but some people
                                            think success is spending all of their money before they
                                            die. This is a risky proposition. There's no way to know how long
                                            your retirement will last and it's common to
                                            underestimate expenses needed in later years. <br><br>
                                            Your goals may fit one or more of these categories. They may also
                                            change as your circumstances and priorities shift.
                                            Having a well-designed, adaptable plan is what's important. Clear

                                    Preparing for your financial future can seem overwhelming—there are so many
                                    variables to consider. But, retirement
                                    planning doesn’t have to be stressful if approached in the right way. Like
                                    any “life-sized” topic, planning how to reach
                                    your financial goals can be easier to tackle in pieces—and with help.
                                    After setting your financial goals, the next critical step in retirement
                                    planning is determining your investment time
                                    horizon—the length of time you need your assets to last. Most people assume
                                    their time horizon is the same as their life
                                    expectancy, but this approach ignores some important details. For example,
                                    if you’re married or in a long-term relationship, you should consider your
                                    partner’s time horizon—particularly if your spouse is younger or likely to
                                    live
                                    longer. Some investors also want to pass a portion of their

                                        In those instances, you should
                                        factor in the children’s or grandchildren’s time horizons. Every
                                        situation is unique and a well-planned retirement
                                        accounts for your circumstances.
                                        Another important step in retirement planning is compiling an income and

                                        retirement accounts.) Better understanding your income needs in
                                        retirement can help you identify any gaps that may need
                                        to be addressed.
                                        Try to incorporate potential tax implications wherever possible. For
                                        example, do you have a traditional IRA or a Roth
                                        IRA? Both? What other sources of retirement income do you expect to
                                        have? Do you have a pension? Social Security? Rental
                                        income?
                                        Starting your retirement plan early can increase your chances for
                                        success. Don’t fret about getting everything exactly
                                        right in the beginning. Projected financial information doesn’t need to
                                        be completely accurate early on, but the more
                                        data you can incorporate, the more realistic a plan you can make.

                                    Once you’ve established your goals and time horizon, you can explore the
                                    investment options and account types available
                                    to you.
                                    Common types of retirement investments include securities—such as stocks,
                                    bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), mutual
                                    funds, and other investment vehicles—as well as real estate. Each investment
                                    type has its unique characteristics. For
                                    instance, some securities like stocks may offer greater growth potential,
                                    while others, such as bonds or real estate,
                                    might provide steady income. Understanding these differences is crucial for
                                    making informed decisions about where to
                                    allocate your retirement savings. When it comes to retirement accounts,

                                        options are available, including traditional 401(k)s, Roth 401(k)s,
                                        traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, and other defined
                                        contribution plans. Although less common today, defined benefit plans
                                        (i.e., pensions) are also an option. Additionally,
                                        some investors opt to purchase annuities with their retirement savings.
                                        The types of investments and accounts you choose, along with their tax
                                        implications, can significantly impact your
                                        retirement strategy. For example, Roth accounts may allow for tax-free
                                        withdrawals if specific criteria are met.
                                        However, contribution limits can affect how much you can save.
                                        Many investors do not fully grasp the risks and benefits associated with
                                        their investments, the account types to
                                        consider, or how to effectively integrate them into a retirement plan.

                                    As you approach retirement, it's crucial to devote more time to refining your retirement plan. Investors seeking to
                                    retire often seek guidance on retirement income strategies, financial planning, and Social Security.
                                    If you're nearing retirement, you may be wondering about the best strategies to generate income from your investments.
                                    The types of securities you invest in often determine your retirement income options.
                                    Many financial advisors suggest shifting your assets more heavily towards income-producing securities, such as bonds, as
                                    you get closer to retirement. However, Assets Globalization Unicorns believes this guidance can be shortsighted.
                                    Investors frequently underestimate how long their assets will need to last in retirement. We help our clients understand
                                    alternative ways to generate retirement income while still achieving the necessary growth for their assets to endure.

                                    As you approach retirement, it's crucial to refine your investment strategy to align with your changing goals and risk
                                    tolerance. Many investors make the mistake of becoming overly conservative too soon, which can limit growth potential
                                    and lead to running out of money later in retirement.
                                    The key is to take a holistic view of your retirement assets and income sources. By working with a qualified financial
                                    advisor, you can develop a personalized investment and withdrawal strategy to help your savings last throughout
                                    retirement. Remember, this is the beginning of a new chapter, not the end of the journey!
