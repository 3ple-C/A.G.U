# assets directory

contains all the following

1. css dir
2. fonts dir
3. images dir
4. js dir
5. webfont dir

All libraries, author written scripts and stylesheets, third party libraries, and images are contained within this directory.

# functions directory

contains author written php scripts which are mostly reused in most, if not all of the main pages of the entire site in this project. Any changes to be made which which influence spans the entire pages of the website can be done from any of the files in this folder. The files which contains code to be reused are included in every page where it is reused.

The two header files 'header.php' and 'header2.php' both contain two diffrent formats of headers which are used in the entire website. The first is used only in the index.php page/script while the latter is used in every other page of the entire website.

The 'footer.php' file contains the footer which is used in literally every page of this website.

The 'settings.php' file/script contains the defined constants which contains several information that are reused in several pages though not all.

## Note Every change made to any of these variables will affect the content of every part in any of the pages where it is used. Also please do well to maintain the pattern of inclusion followed while using these scripts unless you have a proper and better understanding of how php works.

Maintain simplicity and enjoy your work on the project. Chao.
