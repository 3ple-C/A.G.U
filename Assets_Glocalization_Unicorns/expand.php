                                            Once you have a solid understanding of different asset types, you
                                            can better implement those investments in your
                                            strategy. At Assets Globalization Unicorns, we believe the primary
                                            driver of an investor's long-term success is having
                                            the appropriate asset allocation—the mix of stocks, bonds, cash, and
                                            other securities in an overall investment strategy.
                                            A common industry view suggests that asset allocation should change
                                            as you age, with a gradual shift towards "safer"
                                            assets like bonds as you get older.
                                            We disagree with this approach.
                                            We believe this strategy could increase the risk of depleting your
                                            funds in later years. Investors often underestimate
                                            their future needs, including how long their assets need to last. If your goals require investment

                                        growth, you likely
                                        want to maintain a significant portion of your investments in stocks, as they have historically demonstrated superior
                                        long-term growth compared to other asset classes.
                                        At Assets Globalization Unicorns, we believe your asset allocation shouldn't change frequently. We think it should only
                                        be adjusted if your goals or circumstances change significantly. For instance, if you decide to retire earlier than
                                        planned or need to make larger annual withdrawals than anticipated, you should reassess whether your asset allocation
                                        still meets your needs. If not, adjust accordingly.

                                    When you invest in a stock, what exactly are you acquiring? How do mutual funds differ from exchange-traded funds
                                    (ETFs)?
                                    It's surprising how many experienced investors lack complete or accurate answers to these essential investing questions.
                                    Each asset type—stocks, bonds, annuities, mutual funds, and others—operates differently.
                                    At Assets Globalization Unicorns, we observe that many investors do not fully grasp how various assets function and
                                    often overlook the risks involved. Before making any investments, we can help clarify the distinctions between these

                                            Many investors prioritize income-producing assets like bonds and high-dividend stocks, especially when approaching
                                            retirement. However, focusing solely on income can be problematic. It's crucial to understand the distinction between
                                            dividends (a return of capital) and interest income (a return on capital). Dividends are voluntary payments that
                                            companies can cut, leaving investors relying on them without steady income if the companies face distress. Concentrating on dividends alone can also lead to overexposure to certain market sectors that may have lower growth potential. At Assets Globalization Unicorns, we believe looking at total return - both dividend yield and price appreciation - is
                                            most important. This comprehensive approach

                                        can potentially increase overall returns. We recommend a strategy we call "homegrown dividends" - periodically selling
                                        stocks to generate cash flow that complements any dividend or interest income. By understanding income assets and
                                        adopting a total return mindset, investors can build more resilient, lucrative portfolios. A balanced approach
                                        considering both income and growth is often key to long-term investing success.

                                    Your investment income strategy can significantly impact your tax situation, as different asset types come with varying
                                    tax consequences. For instance, interest from corporate bonds is typically taxed at your ordinary income rate, while
                                    profits from stock sales may be subject to lower capital gains rates, depending on how long you’ve held the asset.
                                    Dividends can also be taxed at different rates, often lower than ordinary income tax rates, depending on the type of
                                    investment and your income bracket. Additionally, the tax implications can vary based on the types of investment
                                    accounts you hold, such as traditional IRAs or Roth IRAs, which have different tax treatments upon withdrawal.
                                    Understanding these tax considerations is essential for optimizing your investment strategy and ensuring that you are
                                    aware of how your income will be taxed. By being informed about the tax consequences of your investments, you can make
                                    more strategic decisions that align with your financial goals.
