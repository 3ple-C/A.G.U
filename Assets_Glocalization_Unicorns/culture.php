                                        A key feature of their model is the clear separation between

                                        This division allows team members
                                        to specialize and excel in their specific areas of expertise. The

                                    The organization takes pride in its merit-based approach to hiring and
                                    advancement. Potential, ability, and a positive,
                                    can-do attitude are the primary factors considered when bringing new talent

                                    through its open office layout, where employees at all levels, from new
                                    hires to top executives, share the same
                                    workspace. This approach breaks down traditional hierarchies and encourages

                                    excel in their current positions but also
                                    acquire new skills for future roles within the company.

                                    specific roles or levels but is a common practice across all departments,
                                    positions, and
