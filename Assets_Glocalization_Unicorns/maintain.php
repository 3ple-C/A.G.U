                                            To ensure your money lasts over the long term, it's essential to
                                            gain a clear understanding of your current financial
                                            situation. Start by calculating your net worth and determining your

                                            financial goals. By assessing your financial picture, you can make

                                            and enhance your financial security.

                                    Your investment time horizon—how long you need your money to last—is a
                                    crucial factor in determining your total
                                    retirement costs. Unfortunately, it is often overlooked by retirees.
                                    Understanding your expected time horizon is
                                    essential for effective retirement planning.
                                    An investment time horizon refers to the length of time you plan to hold an
                                    investment before needing to access the
                                    funds. It can range from short-term (less than five years) to long-term
                                    (more than ten years). Factors influencing your
                                    time horizon include your age, financial goals, and lifestyle. For example,
                                    if you're saving for retirement, your time
                                    horizon might span several decades, allowing for a more aggressive
                                    investment strategy.

                                    Many retirees, assuming they should avoid short-term volatility in their
                                    portfolio, often rely too heavily on
                                    investments that offer lower long-term returns than stocks, such as bonds or
                                    cash. Others may avoid global investments
                                    to focus solely on US stocks and bonds. However, doing so can increase the
                                    risk of not meeting their objectives. For
                                    many people, investing during retirement is a long-term exercise that
                                    involves patience and diversification, so don't
                                    let short-term market moves or narrow focus lead you to make emotional

                                    Unfortunately, many investors underestimate their life expectancy and risk depleting their retirement funds prematurely.
                                    Your retirement age is less critical than the duration your money needs to last. It's more important to determine the

                                    This should generally include not only your life expectancy but also the expected lifespans of your spouse and,
                                    potentially, any dependents. You should also factor in goals that extend beyond you and your spouse's lifetimes, such as
                                    any legacy or donation plans.

                                <div class="sec-title_text" style="margin-top: 0px;">
                                    Volatile markets can be unsettling, especially for new retirees. Daily market fluctuations are a normal part of
                                    investing, but overreacting to short-term market movements could jeopardize your long-term investing goals. Instead of
                                    trying to sidestep regular volatility by timing the market—which requires impeccable precision—we at Assets
                                    Globalization Unicorns believe staying committed to a sound investment strategy over the long term is the prudent
                                    approach for most investors.
                                    Taking a broader perspective can help you understand stock market volatility and gain insight. In the short term,
                                    security prices can swing unpredictably and unnerve investors. However, we believe the market tends to reward patient
                                    investors who tolerate market volatility over extended periods.
                                    Remember, market volatility is ever-present and doesn't predict returns or indicate future stock directions. We view
                                    market volatility as the cost investors pay to participate in stocks' historically superior long-term growth potential.

                                <h3 class="service-detail_subtitle">Purchasing Power Erosion</h3>
                                <div class="sec-title_text" style="margin-top: 0px;">
                                    Don't underestimate inflation's impact. Inflation decreases purchasing power over time and can diminish savings and
                                    investment returns. Since 1925, inflation has averaged roughly 3% a year. If that average inflation rate continues, a
                                    person who currently requires $50,000 to cover annual living expenses would need an annual income of approximately
                                    $90,000 in 20 years and about $120,000 in 30 years—just to maintain the same purchasing power.
                                    You should determine your growth objectives and how much money you plan to have in your portfolio at the end of your
                                    investment timeline. For example, if your portfolio grows 5% annually and inflation is 3%, you are essentially only
                                    getting a pre-tax 2% annual return (5% - 2% = 3%). If you require more growth from your investments in retirement, you
                                    may need to allocate a larger portion of your retirement portfolio towards assets with relatively high long-term
                                    expected returns, such as equities.

                                    The rate and amount you withdraw during retirement can impact your overall retirement strategy. Remember that returns
                                    vary over time, so you may not be able to withdraw the same percentage each year without drawing down your principal.
                                    At Assets Globalization Unicorns, we can help you navigate these complex considerations and develop a comprehensive
                                    long-term retirement strategy tailored to your unique needs and goals.
